# AMES---Iowa-Housing-Prices
Performed explanatory data and statistical analysis around 10K houses over the las 100 years in AMES-Iowa. I have developed an Excel qualitative and quantitative analysis, as well as data cleaning and data filtering. The statistical analysis involved correlation and regression model as well as data visualizations thru Power BI.

As a part of the initial analysis some copies of the raw data were created for specifical purposes. THis copies contained: statistical analysis and data cleaning and filtering.

Raw Data - Iowa Housing - Fausto Raw_Data
Data Cleaning / FIltering - Iowa Housing -Fausto Main_Data
Statistical Analysis  - Iowa Housing -Fausto Corr_Reg


The data helped me to understand how the market has behaved in Iowa in the last hundred years as well as breakdown the house configuration and how the price is setup based on a bunch of items that has a direct influence in the price.
