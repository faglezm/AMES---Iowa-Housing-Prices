# AMES---Iowa-Housing-Prices
Performed explanatory data and statistical analysis around 10K houses over the las 100 years in AMES-Iowa. I have developed an Excel qualitative and quantitative analysis, as well as data cleaning and data filtering. The statistical analysis involved correlation and regression model as well as data visualizations thru Power BI.

As a part of the initial analysis some copies of the raw data were created for specifical purposes. THis copies contained: statistical analysis and data cleaning and filtering.
