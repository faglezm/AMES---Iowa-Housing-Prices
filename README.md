# AMES---Iowa-Housing-Prices
Performed explanatory data and statistical analysis around 10K houses over the las 100 years in AMES-Iowa. I have developed an Excel qualitative and quantitative analysis, as well as data cleaning and data filtering. I have applied correlation and regression model and them visualized in Power BI with plus a complementary Power Point presentation.
